            Hi there! I’m Shandrea Piper but you can call me, Piper. As a Computing Applications student, I strive to build a strong foundation of technical abilities in software, data management, and productivity tools. 
            I can use the project management concepts I learn in this class to real-world tech experiences, such as creating well-structured HTML webpages that work correctly and behave as designed.
       </p>

       <p>
         My long-term goal is to work in software development or the tech-related industry, where I can use my passion and skills to improve the industry further. 
         In addition to honing my technical abilities, this course is helping me develop my superpower of coding organization and project execution. 
         At my core, I'm a lifelong student who obsesses over the newest apps, software, and devices, constantly searching and staying updated on the latest trends.
       </p>

        <p>
         I prefer to immerse myself in immersive anime series, such as One Piece, and play video games in my spare time. 
         I'm now enjoying simulation and strategy games such as The Sims 3, Animal Crossing, Marvel Rivals, and Two Point Museum, which help me learn new technologies and improve strategic thinking. 
         My love of gaming and digital worlds fueled my passion for technology, guiding me through my computing applications studies.
        </p>

        <p>
          AI, cybersecurity, and the magical qualities of software interest me. 
          I enjoy applying skills to debug programs and solve complex issues while ultimately working towards earning a degree.
          Every problem allows me to exercise my imagination and reasoning, determine what works, and try different strategies, whether coding, app exploration, or simply obsessing over the newest devices.
